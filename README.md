# US_Accidents
This project is help us understand the accidents happen from 2015 to 2020.I have used CSV  file which  contains details of 3.5 million traffic accidents that took place in the United States, from February 2016 to June 2020.
I have used the python visulization tools to answer following questions.
-  Top states with the most number of accidets
- Top weather conditions during accident
- Top cities during accidents
- Accidents for each Severity level
- Accidents for time
